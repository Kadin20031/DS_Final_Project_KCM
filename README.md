# DS_Final_Project_KCM
This project aims to identify the most critical gameplay variables in League of Legends through quantitative analysis. Using data from 500 personal games and Riot Games’ API, the project will explore over 100 gameplay variables, including objectives, damage, vision, gold income, and player behaviors. By analyzing this data set and applying machine learning models, the project seeks to predict game outcomes, validate predictions using random accounts and future games, and highlight key gameplay factors that influence success.
The primary model for this analysis will be an artificial neural network, chosen for its ability to handle complex, non-linear data and its scalability for continuous updates. Additional models include gradient boosting machines for high prediction accuracy and random forest classifiers for robustness with large datasets. These models will help identify strengths and weaknesses in individual player performances, offering tailored coaching recommendations to increase the chances of winning.
Python will be used for all coding involved in this project. The main libraries that will be used are pandas, numpy, and sklearn for data manipulation, data analysis and machine learning. Riot Games’ developer tools will be used for the data collection. The project’s ultimate goal is to provide players with a clear understanding of which gameplay variables matter most and provide personal recommendations so they can improve their competitive rank in League of Legends.

# Update 2/4/2025
Added data harvesting script that demonstrates functions and code used to gather the data that is used for data analysis in this project. Data analysis python script has been added as well as a report on the data analysis. This data set is challenger League of Legends games spanning 10,957 rows and 138 columns. This data set contains key player statistics that measure player performances in games. I created this data set by creating a data gathering python script that pulled solo queue ranked games from the official league of legends server. The data set can be found on my GitHub profile under DS_Final_Project_KCM. I chose this data set due to my extensive knowledge and experience with league of legends. I figured my long-time experience with the game would allow me to make more meaningful insights into the data set that I am researching. Key data findings such as potential important performance factors and player performance trends can be found inside of the report.
